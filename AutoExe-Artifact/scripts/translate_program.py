            "3. Equivalent here means that the stipulated postcondition should have the same evaluation result (hold/not hold) with the same input as the original program. " +
            "4. Your code should only consists of static public member functions written in one class; do not include multiple classes or instance methods. " +
            "5. Do not try to generate a placeholder for unimplemented functions like func(); leave it in the postcondition alone. " +
            "6. Please preserve all comments, especially the PRE/POST comments. " +
            "7. Please do not include return statements; use assert with POST comment as the last statement works fine. " +
